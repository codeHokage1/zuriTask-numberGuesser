# numberGuesser Game
As a task in the Zuri Backend Dev internship, I wrote a program for a number guessing game.
Hope you enjoy it! :+1: ✨

## Game features:
The game is very easy to play.
- Run the program
- Input your name on first entry
- The first range would be 1 and 2 inclusive; you'd guess the right number between that range
- You get 1 point if you get the answer correctly and move up by 1 level
- The range extends by 1 as well; so if you are in level 2 the range becomes 1 and 3, inclusive
- If you are wrong, the program displays your level and the points you have gathered
- You can run the program as many times as you want!

## How to play:
- Go directly to the repl to run the code: https://replit.com/@FarhanSodiq/zurTask-numberGuesser
- Download the *index.js* file up in the code section and run in your local computer with :
  ```
  node index.js
  ```
  
📢: Be free to open an issue if you have any suggestions on ways to make this game better. I'd be glad to learn from you! 🙏
